                <li>Extremely high damage output with almost all of his moves dealing more than 10 damage, and a few of them doing 20 or more damage.</li>
                <li>A bunch of his moves have superarmor where they effectively act as counters, making him very good at predicting and punishing predictable attacks.</li>
                <li>Flies at 18 speed using his U-special. This gives him a multitude of movement options in neutral, and an incredibly far horizontal recovery. A lot of the time his opponent simply won't have the opportunity to edgeguard him because he will almost always enough fuel to fly under the stage to safety.</li>
                <li>The heaviest character in the game by a longshot, making it so he suffers the least hitstun out of any character and lives the longest both horizontally and vertically(?).</li>
                <li>Very strong punish and techchase game. His D-air leads into his other aerials and his N-air pops them to the ground to be techchased.</li>
                <li>One of the best grab games. Tetron possesses the strongest F-throw in the game, a weaker but still strong B-throw, and a U-throw that deals lots of damage and combos nonfloaties well.</li>
                <li>Has a ton of knockback on most of his moves so he will rarely struggle to take the stock.</li>
                <li>Has a projectile that has notably startup, but is uninteractible, fast and combos well.</li>

            <li>Tetron is the tallest character while still being quite wide, making him a massive target for combos.</li>
            <li>Although his superarmor is great for closing the gap and punishing attacks, he still has trouble with zoning and projectiles.</li>
            <li>Even though he suffers the least hitstun, he is still combo good on behalf of him having a massive hurtbox and the heaviest weight, along with higher than average gravity.</li>
            <li>Very limited vertical recovery. Though it is somewhat rare, he can die even earlier than most characters if he's hit by even a moderately strong spike without a jump.</li>
            <li>Has a hard time dealing with ledgetraps.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The angle of your control stick will influence what direction the bomb is thrown. Holding back or up will make the bomb have no horizontal speed while holding forward will make the bomb have lots of horizontal speed.</li>

                <li>Jab is great for making the bomb move very slowly forward, effectively making it a stationary hazard. You can use this to pressure your opponent while they are hanging on the ledge.</li>
